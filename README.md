## 💻 How to Run

You can compile and run the C++ files using any C++ compiler. Here's how to do it using `g++`:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `.cpp` file.
3. Compile the code:

   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o outputname
````

4. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./outputname
   ```

Alternatively, you can open the files in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like **Visual Studio Code**, **Code::Blocks**, or **CLion** and run them directly from there.

## 🧠 Sample Code

Here's a simple example demonstrating the use of arrays in C++:

```cpp
// array.cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        std::cout << "Element " << i << ": " << arr[i] << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
